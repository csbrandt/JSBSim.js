The contents of this directory is taken from SimGear and is required to compile
JSBSim using the MIPSpro compiler under IRIX and adds header files that are
missing. Note that at least version 7.4 of the MIPSpro compiler is required
otherwise a number of other header files should have been added here.

The following header files where taken from the boost clib package
(http://www.boost.org):

cassert climits  csignal   cstdlib   cwctype
cctype  clocale  cstdarg   cstring
cerrno  cmath    cstddef   ctime
cfloat  csetjmp  cstdio    cwchar
